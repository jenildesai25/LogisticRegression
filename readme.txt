How to run:

There are 3 tasks in questions. LogisticRegression.py contains all the 3 tasks. To run 1st task you need to insert 'Task_1',
To run 2nd task you need to insert 'Task_2', To run 3rd task you need to insert 'Task_3'

Task_1 output:

Dataset iterates over 20000 times.

Accuracy using different learning rate.
Accuracy of 1 learning rate is :95.9
Accuracy of 0.1 learning rate is :96.8
Accuracy of 0.01 learning rate is :95.8

Edge weights:
Task_1.txt contains all the edge weights.

Task_2 output:

Dataset iterates over 10000 times.

They ain't same. Task_2 takes less time than Task_1.
Accuracy using different learning rate.
Accuracy of 1 learning rate is :95.2
Accuracy of 0.1 learning rate is :95.8
Accuracy of 0.01 learning rate is :96.1

Edge weights:
Task_2.txt contains all the edge weights.

Task_3 output:

run LogisticRegression.py and type Task_3 you will see the image or see Task_3.png.
